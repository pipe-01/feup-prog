1) Main Goal of the Game: Survive the Robots & Electrical Posts/Fences
2) Win is achieved if Player Exits through door

4) For every move, robots move one tile closer to your character (H)
5) Death can be by collision with robots or fences/posts

(only one robot is placed in the place of death if two robots collide)
7) Times are recorded and stored in a text file
