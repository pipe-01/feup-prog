PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT STATE:
- All the objectives were accomplished.

- Improvements that were made:
	User can play many time as he want until enter the exit option.
	When a player wins he can write his name to a file, that are sorted by time.
	If a player name already exists and if the time decreases, then winners file is updated and longest time is replaced by newest time.

- Reading from files;
- Arranging the board;
- Organizing code;
