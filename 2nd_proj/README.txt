PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT STATE:
- All the objectives were accomplished.

- Improvements that were made:
Part 1:
	User can play many time as he want until enter the exit option.
	When a player wins he can write his name to a file, that are sorted by time.
	If a player name already exists and if the time decreases, then winners file is updated and longest time is replaced by newest time.
Part 2:
	Classes are correctly implemented for all cases
	Various data structures are being uses
	Correct separation of .h and .cpp files

MAIN DIFFICULTIES:
- Checking valid inputs & collisions between objects;
- Creation of necessary classes;
- Maze class;
- Removing unnecessary code
